# Globe Android

A composable providing a 3D globe, where you can place markers. Use the compose [animations API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/choose-api) to create smooth and performant interactions.

> **ðŸš§: This library is still work in-progress, API may still change at any point.**

The globe asset files are created using [globe-mesh-builder](https://github.com/mullvad/globe-mesh-builder), which in-turn consumes that from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

You find examples in the [`GlobePreview.kt`](./globe/src/main/java/net/mullvad/mullvadvpn/globe/GlobePreview.kt) or by launching the sample app.
